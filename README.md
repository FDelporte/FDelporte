## About me

Software developer/technical lead/writer with more than 20 years of experience in video, multimedia, technical project management, digital signage and (web) programming. Since 2010 I work for Televic Rail in Izegem, Belgium.

My current work tools are Java/Git/Atlassian/IntelliJ IDEA/Visual Studio Code, but also use/used ASP.NET, C#, JavaScript, Angular, SQL Server, Flex, CSS, HTML5, Eclipse, QT,..

I love to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and try to do this in everything I do.

You can hire me for small coding jobs, writing and presenting.
