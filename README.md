## About me

Software developer/technical lead/writer with more than 20 years of experience in video, multimedia, technical project management, digital signage and (web) programming.

My current work tools are Java/Git/Atlassian/AWS/PostgreSQL with IntelliJ IDEA/Visual Studio Code, but also use/used ASP.NET, C#, JavaScript, Angular, SQL Server, Flex, CSS, HTML5, Eclipse, QT,..

I love to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and try to do this in everything I do.

You can hire me for small coding jobs, writing and presenting. 

## Author of "Getting Started with Java on Raspberry Pi"

Controlling physical things with some lines of code is magic! This book includes a lot of info and history about Java itself and how to install it on the Raspberry Pi with many example applications. Also a lot of tips and tricks to become or be a better developer.

The sources of this book are available in a [repository here on GitHub](https://github.com/FDelporte/JavaOnRaspberryPi).
